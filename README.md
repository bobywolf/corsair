# Corsair

When I switched my laptop from Lenovo thinkpad to Apple Macbook pro, it is so amazing that I do not want change back to Windows laptops. [Source Insight](http://www.sourceinsight.com) is the top famous engineering tool to all the software engineerings, because it provides many powerful capabilities such as code browsing, smart editing, function call diagram, and so on. However, there is no such tool like Source Insight in OSX system, what a pity! I am also an software engineer in [taobao.com](https://www.taobao.com), so I decided to build my own tool for code browsing and editing, and I gived it a name called **Corsair**.

  It is the first time that I write an application for OSX system, and [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) was the most widely used editor for Mac OS. Fortunately, textmate has been open source since five years ago, so I think it is a good start for me to write Corsair.
